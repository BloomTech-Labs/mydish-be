# Getting started

To get the server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- **npm i** to install all required dependencies
- **npm run server** to start the local server
- **npm run test** to start server using testing environment

## Back-end Framework

 NodeJs/Express/knex

-    At the beginning of the project about half the devs knew Node/express and half knew Java/spring. Team consensus was that Node would be easier to learn for the Java folks.
-    Sticking to a JavaScript language framework on the front end and back end would make transitioning between front and back end teams easier when roles would need to change.
